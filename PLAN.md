## Phase 6 — "Gate" to move beyond Empfehlung A

20. **Acceptance checklist (to declare A done)**

- Correctness: WAV output valid, voices selectable, errors surfaced cleanly
- Operability: reproducible install, logs/metrics, timeouts
- Baseline performance: documented numbers for your target CPU

21. **Handoff artifacts for "Empfehlung B (native)"**

- Deliverable: a small benchmark harness + sample inputs/voices that you can reuse to validate any native/ONNX approach later.
